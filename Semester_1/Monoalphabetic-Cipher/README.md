# _**Monoalphabetic Cipher**_

A Python implementation of the Monoalphabetic Cipher by me, a simple substitution cipher that uses a fixed key to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## **_Overview_**

The Monoalphabetic Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a corresponding letter from the key. The key is a permutation of the uppercase alphabet. This implementation provides methods for both encryption and decryption using the Monoalphabetic Cipher.

## **_Usage_**

To use this implementation, create an instance of the `MonoalphabeticCipher` class by providing a key (a permutation of the uppercase alphabet). You can then use the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods to process messages.

## **_Key Features_**

- **Encryption:** The `encrypt` method takes a plaintext string and returns the encrypted version using the Monoalphabetic Cipher.
- **Decryption:** The `decrypt` method takes a ciphertext string and returns the decrypted version using the Monoalphabetic Cipher.
- **User Interface:** The program includes a simple command-line interface allowing users to interactively encrypt or decrypt messages.
